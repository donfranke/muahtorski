#Welcome!#
Welcome to my GitHub site, which has a collection of repositories from various projects (many security-related) I've worked on over the years. More information about myself is also at [donfranke.com](https://donfranke.com/). There you can find links to articles I've written among other things. I enjoy coding and learning new things, and my goal for this year to is get a certification in the 3 leading cloud providers solutions. I've also been doing LeetCode problems off and on to learn more about algorithms and Rust.
