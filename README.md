#Welcome!#
Welcome to my GitHub site, which has a collection of repositories from various projects (many security-related) I've worked on over the years. More information about myself is also at [donfranke.com](https://donfranke.com/). There you can find links to articles I've written among other things. I enjoy coding and learning new things, and my goal for this year to is get a certification in the 3 leading cloud providers solutions. I've also been doing LeetCode problems off and on to learn more about algorithms and Rust. If I'm able to tie all this together with securitry, which is where my career has landed, so much the better. 

Overall, I feel anything you learn has the potential to be usable at some point in life, work, or both. I appreciate GitHub because it is a great tool for learning from source code, and to collaborate with other developers on projects.
